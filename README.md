#  RECHORD Coding Test

Rechord is all about Audio. This test app uses AudioKit to load and play audio files... but it has problems.

## Please could you:
 - Get it compiling!
 - Find and fix the issue that can cause more than one audio file to play at the same time.
 - When loading the loop wav file, make it loop when being played.
 - Assess the code and fix any potential runtime crashes.
 
## Please make the follow Interface changes
 - Please split the "PLAY OR STOP" button into two separate buttons, and only show the PLAY button if the audio is not playing, and only show the STOP button if the audio is playing.
 - Refactor RechordView so it's cleaner and better structured
 - Add a Text() element above the buttons to show the name of the loaded file.
 - Make the buttons take up the available width, and give them a height of 50pts

Please fork this repo and make the above changes. Feel free to refactor the code as you see fit.

Have fun!
